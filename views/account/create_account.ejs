          <h1 class="code-conduct-header">Aquamarine Code of Conduct</h1>
          <p>Before creating an Aquamarine account, please read the Aquamarine Code of Conduct first, so you can see all
            the allowed and not allowed things to do on Aquamarine.</p>
          <p>This code of conduct contains very detailed information, please read carefully, it can be also readed as
            many times as you want after creating your account and going to your User Settings.</p>
          <h2 class="guide-1">Posts can be read by anyone around the world</h2>
          <p>All the posts that are written on Aquamarine, including drawings and text posts, and both, can be seen by
            any person over 13.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind, that if you want to talk to someone you know, like a friend, about a more private theme, you
            can do this with an direct message.</p>
          <p class="guideline-i1">This is why it is advised to keep everything in an appropiate level, NSFW drawings,
            hate speech, and anything that is considered offensive, racist, and innapropiate, are not allowed at
            all on Aquamarine, and any post containing this will be deleted and the account will be taken down/banned.
          </p>

          <h2 class="guide-2">Be nice to one another</h2>
          <p>In order to keep Aquamarine an fun place for everyone, we ask you to be considerate to other users.</p>
          <p class="guideline-i2">Treat users as the same way you want them to treat you, do not insult or offend
            anyone, and if someone is being offensive with you or another user, you can report them from their latest
            post.</p>

          <h2 class="guide-3">Do not share your personal information - Yours or Others</h2>
          <p>Remember that meeting people on Aquamarine is not the same as meeting them in real life.</p>
          <p class="guideline-i3">Never share your personal e-mail address, social medias, address, school, or private
            information to anyone you meet in Aquamarine, and if someone asks you for such, tell them that it is not
            allowed as said
            in the code of conduct, if they keep insisting, you can feel free to report them in their latest post.</p>

          <h2 class="guide-4">Do not post Spoilers</h2>
          <p>There are people that are playing games in their first time, looking for tips, tricks and questions.</p>
          <p class="guideline-i4">However, some people like to discover everything on their own, if you are going to do
            an post and you are going to mention something that you think,
            not all users might know about, check the Spoilers box before posting, so people will have to manually
            choose if see your spoiler or not, depending of the post viewing settings of the user.</p>

          <h2 class="guide-5">Have common sense</h2>
          <p>And that is the final rule, just have common sense.</p>
          <p>Enjoy Aquamarine and feel free to post about anything you want, but have common sense before posting or
            commenting, and think about what other people might think if you have
            included suggestive content on your post/comment or ever profile, after that, just enjoy the service!
